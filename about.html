                                            with a unified theme, quite like a symphony, a new theme that once
                                            crystallized would resonate a personal, service-based model never before
                                            experienced.

                                if one has not dined well". Keeping that in mind RAV has started an organic revolution
                                with a 200+ acre Organic farm at Naimisharanya and more than five others are in line.
                                Chain of an Organic Food Court(Bhoj Organica) is also on the way to meet our motto, and
                                that is "Let food be thy medicine, thy medicine shall be thy food"</p>

                                rate in itself speaks volumes about the quality of the products, the marketing
